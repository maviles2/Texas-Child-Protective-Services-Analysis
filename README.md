# Texas-Child-Protective-Services-Analysis

## CPS 7.1 Removals - by Region with Child Demographics FY08- FY18

The following project will focus on analyzing the data from the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services (DFPS); this data is concerning statistics on children who are in foster care, have been removed, and are currently waiting to be adopted. I am interested in identifying the differences between two different regions, in the state of Texas, affecting the number of children removed. This analyzation will specifically focus on comparing the removal data from Austin, TX, and El Paso, TX. Austin, Texas, is the capital of the state, and El Paso, Texas, was ranked as one of the safest cities in the country hence the reason for the selection of these two cities. The analyzation will look at factors such as age and gender, affecting the number of removals in these two cities. Being able to identify if there are differences between these geographical regions within the state, will allow for a better understanding of these communities and better policymaking. This analyzation can overall be useful for the state of Texas, DFPS employees, and the population residing in these geographical areas of Texas.
